//! Every integration binary here truncates `lumberroom_rust_test`, and each carries its own
//! `static SERIAL` mutex. A mutex serialises threads inside one process, and these are six
//! processes, so nothing stopped `tests/console_cleanup` truncating the table `tests/cleanup` was
//! part way through asserting against.
//!
//! It fails the way shared state always does: every file passes on its own and two of them fail in
//! a full run, with an assertion that reads like a logic bug. The two that failed were a proposal
//! whose members had gone and a survivor chosen from a cluster that had changed underneath, both of
//! which are exactly what a truncate from another process looks like from the inside.
//!
//! A Postgres advisory lock is held by a session rather than by a process, so every binary queues
//! on the same one. It is released when the connection closes, which is what dropping the guard
//! does.
