//! `lumberroom import`. Bringing a memory out of somebody else's product.

//! Separate from `ingest`, which reads transcripts this machine already owns. Import starts from a
//! file the owner fetched out of ChatGPT or claude.ai, and the two halves of that arrive by
//! different routes: conversations come in an export archive, and a memory store comes either in
//! the same archive, as claude.ai's `memories` part does, or through the assistant itself, which is
//! what `dump_prompt` is for.
//!
//! The split decides the bill. Conversations go through extraction and spend provider tokens. A
//! memory dump is already a list of facts, so it reaches the proposal queue with no model in the
//! path and no key configured.
//!
//! Nothing here hands the server a transcript. `ingest::mod` states the reason the client is its own
//! binary, and import keeps to it: the parse happens on the machine holding the file, and only
//! proposals cross the wire.
