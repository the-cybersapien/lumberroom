//! `lumberroom ingest extract --batch`, the Mode C driver.

//! Spec §10.11. Mode B posts one request per chunk and waits. Mode C posts every chunk as one job,
//! walks away, and collects the results on a later invocation. Both write the same
//! `out/chunk-NN.json`, so `submit` cannot tell which mode produced a chunk and needs no change.
//!
//! **The spans sit in a third party's object storage for 30 days.** OpenRouter keeps batch inputs
//! and results as JSONL artifacts in Google Cloud Storage and deletes them 30 days after the batch

//! retains for abuse monitoring; a batch leaves them at rest somewhere the owner cannot reach. The
//! confirm prompt says so before anything goes out, and `HELP` says so before the owner types the
//! flag.
//!
//! **Turnaround is a day.** `24h` is the only completion window OpenRouter supports, so one round
//! of tuning the prompt costs a day. Calibrate with Mode A or Mode B on a handful of chunks and

//! Verified against OpenRouter's batch quickstart on 21 August 2026: the endpoints, the key-order

pub const HELP: &str = "\
lumberroom ingest extract --run <id> --batch [flags]

Mode C. Post every chunk of a run as one batch job and collect the results
later. Roughly half the per-token price on the providers that publish a
discount, in exchange for up to a day of turnaround.

  --batch          submit the batch, or advance one this run already has:
                   poll it while it runs, split it once it is complete
  --batch-status   print the job's status and its counts. Creates nothing
  --batch-fetch    split a completed batch into out/chunk-NN.json
  --dry-run        print the estimate and the first request. Send nothing
  --retry-failed   batch only the chunks state.json marked failed. On a run
                   whose batch has finished, this submits a second batch and
                   replaces the first one's record

The batch id lands in state.json, so a lost out/ directory costs a re-fetch
instead of a re-send. Running --batch again on a submitted job polls it and
never creates a second one, so a scheduler can call this on a timer.

What the owner is agreeing to
  The spans leave this machine and sit in the provider's object storage for
  30 days. OpenRouter writes batch inputs and results to Google Cloud Storage
  and deletes them 30 days after creation. That is a different exposure from a
  synchronous call, where the spans live in the request path.

  24h is the only completion window on offer. Tune the prompt with Mode A or
  Mode B first, where a bad instruction costs seconds.

  A started batch may not be stoppable. OpenRouter's status list carries
  cancelling and cancelled and its documentation names no cancellation
  endpoint, so a submitted batch costs whatever it costs.

Every chunk gets a line. A result that will not parse, an error item and a
custom id that never came back all land in state.json as failed chunks, which
`extract --retry-failed` picks up and `submit` counts in chunks_failed.
