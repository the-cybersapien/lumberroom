# Two build requirements the spike established the hard way (docs/rust-spike-findings.md):
#   g++      ONNX Runtime links libstdc++, and rust:slim ships gcc without it. Without this the
#            build dies at the link step with "cannot find -lstdc++".
#   network  `ort` downloads a prebuilt ONNX Runtime, and the prefetch downloads model weights.

# Everything the build reads, in one layer. COPY of a directory is recursive by construction, so
# nothing here has to enumerate src/'s subdirectories.
#
# build.rs has to be here. Cargo detects a build script by its presence, so leaving it out gives a
# build with no script at all: the stamp still reaches `option_env!` through rustc's environment,
# and cargo never learns the environment is an input, so the next build reuses yesterday's stamp out
# of the cache mount and the binary claims a commit it was not built from.

# One build, with target/ and the registry carried between builds by BuildKit cache mounts.
#
# This replaces two things that used to fight each other. A stub `fn main() {}` was built first to
# cache the dependency compile in an image layer; then `COPY src` brought the real sources in with
# their host mtimes, which were older than that stub's artifacts, so cargo's mtime freshness check
# skipped the real build and the image shipped the stub: a 325KB binary and an empty /models, past
# every check in the file. `find src crates -exec touch` was the fix, and it forced a full rebuild
# of the whole workspace on every single build. The optimisation and its patch cancelled out.
#
# A cache mount is what the stub was approximating, done properly. With no stub there is no artifact
# that is newer than the sources for a spurious reason: what the cache holds corresponds to the last
# real source state, so comparing mtimes means what it is supposed to mean and the touch can go.
#
# `sharing=locked` because two concurrent builds writing one target/ corrupt it, which is the same
# reason scripts/cargo.sh serialises.
#
# **A cache mount is not part of the image.** Nothing under /build/target survives this RUN, so the
# binaries are copied to /out inside it, and the runtime stage takes them from there. Copying them
# from /build/target in a later stage finds an empty directory and fails the build, which is the one
# way to get this wrong.
#
# --workspace, because the root is a package and a bare `cargo build` at a workspace root builds
# only that one. Without it the client is never built and the size assertion passes on the binary that
# did get built.
#
# The stamp goes in as environment on the build command, and build.rs declares it as an input so a
# changed sha recompiles the crate that reads it. `/readyz` reports the three values back, which is
# how you tell a container running the image you just built from one `docker restart` brought back
# on the old one. Unset means `unknown`, and so does empty: `--build-arg LUMBERROOM_BUILD_SHA=` passes
# an empty string that the ARG default does not catch.

# /models measures ~209MB against an expected ~110MB. An earlier finding attributed this to Docker COPY

# Verified against the built image and that is not what is happening: `snapshots/` is 20KB of
# intact symlinks, `blobs/` holds the real 209MB alone, no duplication. The actual cause is that
# `EmbeddingModel::BGEBaseENV15Q` in src/adapters/embedding/local.rs is already the most-quantized
# variant fastembed exposes for this model, and it resolves to Qdrant/bge-base-en-v1.5-onnx-Q's
# `model_optimized.onnx`, which is ~218MB, almost exactly 2 bytes/parameter (fp16), not the
# ~1 byte/parameter (int8) an equivalent q8 export would be. There is no COPY-layer fix for that;
# it is a model-selection question for whoever owns src/adapters/embedding. Left as-is here rather
# than guessed at. See docs/traps.md for this finding in full.

# in the server image put a binary there that the server never executes, and made one image the
# answer to two different questions.
#
# It shares nothing with the runtime stage above on purpose. The client embeds no model, links no
# ONNX Runtime and reads no key, so it needs neither the 209MB of weights nor libstdc++: a debian
# base, ca-certificates for TLS to a provider, and a 5MB binary.
#
# `docker compose --profile cleanup up -d` builds this target. Releasing the client for a person to
# run on a laptop is a different job again, and wants cross-platform artefacts from CI rather than
# an image.
