description: >
    Forces recall on every incoming message by calling lumberroom's context_bootstrap tool and
    prepending the digest as a system message, before the model's tool-choice loop ever runs.

Paste this whole file into OpenWebUI: Admin Panel -> Settings -> Functions -> + -> paste -> Save,
then open the function's Valves and set lumberroom_url and lumberroom_token. Enable it globally or per model.

SINGLE-OWNER ONLY. DO NOT ENABLE THIS ON A MULTI-ACCOUNT OPENWEBUI INSTANCE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
lumberroom_token is one valve, set once, shared by every OpenWebUI account this function is enabled
for. OpenWebUI has no per-user credential valve to key it off instead. `_digest_for`'s cache is
keyed per `__user__["id"]` purely to keep one fast conversation from calling lumberroom on every
message; that keying is a cache-locality choice, not an access boundary, and it does not change
which token fetches the digest or what the digest contains. The digest itself is
`context_bootstrap`'s full render for whatever grant `lumberroom_token` carries: every readable
registry key with its value, project summaries, everything that credential can see. Enabling this
filter globally, or for any model a second account can reach, hands that owner's whole digest to
every account with a chat open. This is exactly the deployment
[decision 0002](../docs/decisions/0002-built-in-oauth-server.md) rules out: lumberroom assumes one
owner. If OpenWebUI ever grows a per-account credential valve, wire this filter to it before
enabling it anywhere the owner is not the only account.

WHY THIS FILE MATTERS MORE THAN ITS SIZE SUGGESTS
--------------------------------------------------
Every other surface lumberroom connects to (Claude Code, Hermes, Claude.ai, ChatGPT) leaves recall to
the model's own judgment: the tool is available and the model may or may not call it. OpenWebUI's
Filter `inlet` hook is different. It runs on every incoming message, before the request reaches
the model at all, which makes it the only mechanism across every connected surface that can FORCE
recall rather than ask for it. If lumberroom's numbers ever show a surface reading but never writing,
this file is the proof that "the model chose not to call it" and "the model was never given the
chance" are different failures. OpenWebUI removes the second one entirely.

CONTRACT
--------
- class Filter, a pydantic Valves config on it, and an async def inlet(self, body, __user__).
  This matches OpenWebUI's Filter convention exactly; do not rename these.
- Fails open on every error path: a bad URL, a wrong token, a timeout, a malformed response, or
  the server being down all fall through to returning `body` unchanged. A lumberroom outage must never
  break the user's chat, and a filter that raises stops the conversation dead.
- Caches the digest per user for `cache_seconds`, so a fast back-and-forth conversation does not
  turn into one lumberroom call per message. The cache lives on the Filter instance, which OpenWebUI
  keeps alive across requests, so this is a plain dict rather than anything external.
- Sends X-Memory-Invocation: hook, the same header lumberroom's own SessionStart hook sends, so this
  counts as forced recall in `lumberroom stats` rather than the model choosing to call a tool: those
  are different numbers and conflating them would make the Phase 2 measurement meaningless.
- Uses only httpx, which ships with OpenWebUI's backend already. No other dependency.
