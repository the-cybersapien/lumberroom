# The published copy of this file lives at Formula/lumberroom.rb in the tap
# the-cybersapien/homebrew-lumberroom, and that copy is what brew installs. This one is the staging
# copy: prepare a version here alongside the release it targets, then copy it across. brew resolves
# formula lookups by path inside a tap, not by where the source happens to live before that.

      Point this binary at a running lumberroom server before using it:
        lumberroom doctor

      To wire up Claude Code on this machine (MCP server, SessionStart hook, CLAUDE.md rule),
      use the wiring script from the source repository:
        client/wire-mac.sh --url https://your-lumberroom-host
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Both checks run offline. `version` is the one subcommand that answers without a server and
    # exits zero, which is why it exists as a command and not only as a flag. The unknown command
    # covers the other half: argument parsing and dispatch reaching a fixed message and exit 1.
