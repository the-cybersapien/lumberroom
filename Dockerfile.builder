# musl-tools and the x86_64 cross gcc are here for scripts/cli-release.sh, which used to apt-get
# them inside the container on every release build. The scout measured roughly 60s of the 188s run
# on that repeat. Baking them in also takes the last root-only step out of that script, which is
# what lets it run under the same non-root uid as everything else. `rustup target add` stays in the
# script: RUSTUP_HOME is world-writable here and rust-toolchain.toml pins a channel this image does
# not carry, so a target added at build time would belong to the wrong toolchain.

# watchexec drives the `dev` service in docker-compose.yml: it watches the bind-mounted sources and
# restarts the debug binary when one changes. Rust has no hot reload of its own, and cargo has no
# watch mode, so a running server picks up an edit by being killed and started again.
#
# A prebuilt musl binary rather than `cargo install watchexec-cli`, which compiles a second
# dependency tree from source every time this image is rebuilt. The checksum is verified because
# this is a release artifact fetched over the network into a toolchain image. The published
# .sha256 holds a bare hash with no filename, so the two-space form sha256sum -c wants is built here.
#
# `uname -m` rather than the TARGETARCH build arg: TARGETARCH is only populated under BuildKit, and
# this image is built by hand as often as by compose. uname reports aarch64 and x86_64, which is
# already the spelling the release assets use.

# ── cargo does not run as root here ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# scripts/lib/builder-entrypoint.sh drops to BUILDER_UID before it execs anything, and carries the
# rest of the reasoning.

# /home/builder is 0777 because the uid is not known until the container starts, and a throwaway
# build container with one user in it has nothing to protect there. It holds no cache: CARGO_HOME
# and RUSTUP_HOME arrive world-writable from the rust image and stay where they are.
