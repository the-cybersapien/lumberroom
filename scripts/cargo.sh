# ── the container outlives the command that started it, unless something stops it ────────────────
#
# `docker run --rm` removes the container when it exits on its own. It does nothing when this script
# is killed: the signal reaches the docker client, the client dies, and the container keeps running
# with cargo still holding the lock on /app/target. Every later run then sits on "Blocking waiting
# for file lock on build directory" until it is killed too, and leaves another one behind. Two dead
# runs are enough to make the suite look hung for no reason anybody can see.
#
# Two things stop that. A trap removes this run's own container on any signal it can catch, which
# needs the `exec` gone: exec replaces this shell and takes its traps with it. And because SIGKILL
# catches nothing, a sweep first removes any container from an earlier run whose owner is no longer
# alive. The owner's pid rides along as a label, so "no longer alive" is a question with an answer
# rather than a guess about age.

# target/ in a named volume rather than on the bind mount, and the same volume the `dev` compose
# service uses. Two reasons. Rust build I/O through virtiofs dominates a rebuild on macOS, and
# without this the repository carries two build directories for one checkout: this one on the host
# and the dev loop's inside Docker.
#
# It does not halve anything. `check` and `test` build the dev profile and the dev loop builds
# `dev-release`, and cargo keeps those in separate subdirectories, so the dependency tree still
# compiles once for each. What is shared is the volume, the registry and the fingerprint database.
#
# The cost: a `test` run while the dev loop is up blocks on cargo's build-directory lock until the
# dev loop's build finishes. That is cargo serialising two real builds rather than the stale
# container problem above, and it clears on its own.
#
# target/ no longer appears on the host. `docker run --rm -v lumberroom-target:/t alpine ls /t` reads it.
#
# CARGO_INCREMENTAL is deliberately not set here, which leaves incremental compilation on.
# It held 21.5GB of the 54.9GB this volume reached and turning it off looks like the obvious win.
# It is not. Measured, edit one source file and rebuild `test -j 1 -p lumberroom --no-run`:
#
#   incremental on    15s  17s        incremental off    31s  28s  31s
#
# and on lumberroom-cloud, which is twelve times the source, 74s against 125s. Doubling the loop
# every agent and every human on this repo runs all day is not worth 21.5GB, and the 21.5GB was
# never the price of incremental anyway. It was thousands of dead unit-hashes nobody had built in
# weeks, because nothing pruned. scripts/lib/prune-target.sh below does, on a two day window for
# incremental and seven for everything else.

# BUILDER_UID is what stops cargo running as root in here. Root ignores permission bits, so every
# test that asserts a refusal from the filesystem passed under it whatever the code did.
# scripts/lib/builder-entrypoint.sh does the drop and carries the detail.
# The host account's own uid, so that on a Linux host the bind-mounted tree stays writable by the
# user who owns it; under Colima on macOS the mount answers to any uid and only the non-zero part
# matters. Measured cost: 13ms of stat per run, plus one 1.0s chown of the two volumes, once.

#
# Skipped while another cargo container is alive. The prune only ever removes artifacts untouched
