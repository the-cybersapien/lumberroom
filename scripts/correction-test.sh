# The Phase 4 exit criterion: "a correction you make once does not resurface as a contradiction
# later" (system PRD §7). Phase 4 spec's "Exit test" lays out the steps; this follows them, plus
# the numeric-guard case the spec calls out as the reason supersession exists at all.
#
#   ./scripts/correction-test.sh                      its own server, its own database
#   LUMBERROOM_URL=https://memory.example.com LUMBERROOM_TOKEN=... ./scripts/correction-test.sh --live
#
# With no argument this stands up a scratch server on --port (default 8791, never 8787) against a
# database named lumberroom_correction_test, runs against that, and drops it afterwards. Every step here
# writes nonce-tagged rows, and on 21 August 2026 a run against 127.0.0.1:8787 left four of them in
# the owner's user:me, two of which survived to reach the next session's digest as facts about him.
# A gate that writes is a gate that needs its own store.
#
# --live runs against LUMBERROOM_URL with LUMBERROOM_TOKEN, which needs write access to
# LUMBERROOM_CORRECTION_NAMESPACE (default "user:me") and mayDelete, because a live run deletes every row
# it wrote before it exits. --live --keep-rows skips that teardown.
#
# The Phase 4 spec frames its exit test as three model sessions (A states a fact, B states the
# correction, C asks the question). This script drives the same three moments directly through
# memory_write/memory_search rather than through a live model session: scripts/done-when-test.sh
# already proves a model chooses to call these tools on its own, so re-proving that here would
# duplicate that script rather than add to it. What this proves instead, and what the spec's own
# steps 1, 2 and 4 check, is that the server keeps the correction, the conflict, and the history
# straight once it is told about them.
#
# Follows the house pattern in scripts/done-when-test.sh: bash, set -euo pipefail, curl and node
# only, a nonce per run, coloured PASS/FAIL lines, non-zero exit on any failure, a summary at the
# end.

  5  two texts that differ only in a digit run never collapse into one row, however similar the
     embeddings are, and the older one is flagged as a possible conflict instead
  6  resolving that flagged conflict through 'lumberroom supersede' produces the same end state as an
     inline correction: the new value answers, the old one does not, and history survived
