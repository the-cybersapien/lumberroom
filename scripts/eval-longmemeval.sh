# Runs LongMemEval-S against a scratch server and a scratch database, never the owner's live
# store. That is the one property this script exists to guarantee, so read the rest with that in
# mind: every host, port and database name below is chosen to stay off 127.0.0.1:8787 and off the
# `lumberroom` database.
#
#   ./scripts/eval-longmemeval.sh --protocol session-as-document --limit 20 --out report.json
#   ./scripts/eval-longmemeval.sh --dataset /path/to/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json --resume
#
# Flags, all optional:
#   --dataset PATH   the LongMemEval-S JSON file. Default: ./longmemeval_s_cleaned.json,
#                     the name the fetch command below leaves it under.
#   --protocol NAME   session-as-document (default, comparable to agentmemory's published run)
#                     or chunked (not comparable; see docs/eval-longmemeval.md).
#   --limit N         stop after N questions, for a smoke run before the full 500.
#   --resume          skip a question whose namespace already holds rows.
#   --out PATH        where the JSON report is written.
#   --port N          the scratch server's port. Default 8788, never 8787.
#   --isolate         delete each question's haystack once it is scored, so the next question meets
#                       an empty store. This is the configuration comparable to a published run
#                       that built a fresh index per question, and it says the least about scale.
#   --corpus-wide     search without the namespace filter, so every question competes against every
#                       session in the corpus. The hardest of the three and the most realistic.
#   --keep            leave the lumberroom_eval database in place after the run. Without this flag the
#                     script drops it on exit; with it, drop it later with:
#                       docker compose exec db dropdb -U <POSTGRES_USER> lumberroom_eval
#
# LUMBERROOM_CLI, if set, is a path to an already-built lumberroom binary and the harness runs on the host
# through it, talking to the scratch server's mapped port. Unset, the harness runs inside the
# builder image (build it once: docker build -t lumberroom-builder -f Dockerfile.builder .), which is
# slower on a cold cache but needs nothing installed on the host.
#
# The dataset is not checked in. Fetch it with:
#   curl -L -o longmemeval_s_cleaned.json \
#     https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned/resolve/main/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json

# Five settings on the scratch server that a reader has to know about to read the number
# honestly, each a deliberate departure from the owner's real deployment defaults:
#
#   EMBED_PROVIDER=local, EMBED_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2, EMBED_DIM=768
#     all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is the model agentmemory's published numbers were produced with. It embeds
#     at 384 dimensions and the store zero-pads that into the 768-dim column the schema already
#     has; cosine is invariant under zero padding, so this needs no second column and no second
#     database. Running any other embedder here would measure the embedder, not the search stack.
#   SENSITIVITY_TRIPWIRE=false
#     LongMemEval's synthetic sessions contain API-key-shaped and token-shaped text by design,
#     which is exactly what the tripwire exists to refuse. A refused write removes a session from
#     the haystack for a reason that has nothing to do with retrieval, which is the same failure
#     mode as a write-ceiling truncation below and just as fatal to the number.
#   WRITE_MAX_CONTENT_CHARS=200000
#     The comparable protocol writes a whole haystack session as one document, and a real session
#     rendered whole runs past the default 8000-char write ceiling. Raised well past the longest
#     session in the set rather than tuned to it, so nothing here is silently truncated either.
#   SEARCH_INCLUDE_ALL_PROJECTS=false
#     Each question's haystack lives in its own project: namespace (see question_namespace in
#     crates/lumberroom/src/eval/mod.rs). Leaving this at the server default of true would let one
#     question's search see every other question's sessions, which is not what a per-question
#     recall number is supposed to measure.
#   PUBLIC_URL=http://<container>:<port>
#     rmcp validates the Host header against an allowlist derived from this, defaulting to loopback
#     only. The harness reaches the server by container name, so without this every tool call comes
#     back 403 while /healthz and /readyz answer normally.
#
#   AUTH_MODE=token
#     The eval has no need for OAuth, and a static token keeps the run's own authorization out of
#     the variables being measured.
