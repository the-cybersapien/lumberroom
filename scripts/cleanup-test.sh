  1  a duplicate cannot be made through the write path, so this one was seeded around it
  2  the deterministic pass groups on normalised text and queues one proposal per cluster
  3  running it again queues nothing, which is the whole argument for an hourly cadence
  4  the queue names the kind, the producer, and which of the rows survives
  5  applying retires through supersession: history survives and the survivor still answers
  6  the queue is behind a grant, so a client the owner did not name cannot fill it
