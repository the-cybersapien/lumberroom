#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sourced by a gate script, never executed. Stands up a throwaway lumberroom server against its own
# database so a gate that writes nonce-tagged rows cannot write them into the owner's store.
#
# scripts/correction-test.sh ran against 127.0.0.1:8787 on 21 August 2026 and left four rows in
# user:me. Two of them survived as live memories and reached the next session's digest as facts
# about the owner. The port and the database name are checked here rather than trusted, because
# both are one flag away from being the real ones.
#
# The caller sets these before calling scratch_start:
#
#   SCRATCH_DB       database name. Refused when it equals POSTGRES_DB.
#   SCRATCH_PORT     host port. Refused when it is 8787.
#   SCRATCH_NAME     container name.
#   SCRATCH_TOKENS   the AUTH_TOKENS JSON the gate needs.
#   SCRATCH_EMBED    hash | local. Default hash. A gate whose assertions turn on similarity
#                    between two texts needs local; one that only moves rows around does not.
#   SCRATCH_KEK      unset for KEK_PROVIDER=none, or "env" to generate a key and hold it in the
#                    container's environment. A gate that writes a private or sealed row needs it.
#
# After scratch_start returns:
#
#   SCRATCH_URL           reachable from this host
#   SCRATCH_INTERNAL_URL  reachable from a container on the same docker network
#
# scratch_stop removes the container and drops the database. Call it from the gate's own trap.
