#
# With no argument this stands up a scratch server on --port (default 8790, never 8787) against a
# database named lumberroom_policy_test, mints both credentials with the grants described below, runs
# against that, and drops it afterwards. Steps 1 and 3 write into personal:finance and
# personal:health, and a gate that writes into the owner's private namespaces to prove he cannot
# read them has already cost him more than it told him.
#
# --live runs against LUMBERROOM_URL with the two tokens below, already configured in AUTH_TOKENS. The
# full credential needs mayDelete there, because a live run deletes every row it wrote before it
# exits. --live --keep-rows skips that teardown.
#
# Two credentials are required, already configured in AUTH_TOKENS on the server:
#
#   full    read/write "*" at sealed, sealed_capable, registryWrite. The owner's own client.
#   narrow  read/write restricted so it excludes LUMBERROOM_POLICY_TEST_NAMESPACE (default
#           "personal:finance", which classifies private by default; see the namespace defaults
#           table in Phase 3 spec §2). A grant of
#             read:  [{"namespace":"user:me","max":"open"},{"namespace":"global","max":"sealed"}]
#             write: [{"namespace":"user:me","max":"open"},{"namespace":"global","max":"open"}]
#           excludes it correctly. registryWrite is NOT required on narrow, and sealedCapable must
#           stay off: step 4 asks this credential for a sealed row and expects ciphertext back.
#           The sealed READ ceiling on LUMBERROOM_POLICY_TEST_OPEN_NAMESPACE is what step 4 needs. A
#           ceiling of open there makes /admin/sealed answer 403 naming the sealed ceiling, because
#           the server drops every namespace the caller cannot read at the sealed level before it
#           looks anything up. sealedCapable, not the ceiling, is what decides whether the bytes are
#           readable.
#
#           narrow ALSO needs LUMBERROOM_POLICY_TEST_CEILING_NAMESPACE (default "personal:health") in its
#           read grant, at a ceiling of open:
#             read:  [..., {"namespace":"personal:health","max":"open"}]
#           That is the two-axis case, and step 3 is the only step that reaches it. Every other step
#           uses a namespace the narrow grant does not name, so the namespace axis refuses first and
#           the sensitivity axis is never asked. A grant that names a namespace whose content the
#           defaults classify above open is what exercises the second axis, and a count published
#           beside a refused row is what step 3 catches.
#
# Follows the house pattern in scripts/done-when-test.sh: bash, set -euo pipefail, curl and node
# only, a nonce per run, coloured PASS/FAIL lines, non-zero exit on any failure, a summary at the
# end.

cat <<SUMMARY
  1  the full credential can write private content the narrow grant does not reach
  2  memory_search, context_bootstrap (digest text, the inventory, and counts.by_namespace), and
     registry_get all agree: the narrow credential sees nothing there, and a write into it is
     refused rather than silently dropped
  3  the second axis on its own: in a namespace the narrow grant NAMES at open, a row above open
     changes no count in that credential's digest, and an open row still does. Names and counts are
     the disclosure a nonce grep cannot see
  4  the full credential's own view of its own fact is unaffected
  5  a sealed row is served as ciphertext regardless of grant; only a client holding the matching
     local key recovers the plaintext
  6  a credential-shaped write at 'open' is refused, names the rule, suggests sealed, and never
     echoes the secret back
  7  both denials are observable afterward, not silent
  8  /statsz and /admin/export authorize rather than only authenticate: the narrow credential gets
     its own rows, no other client's name, no tenant-wide row count, and nothing out of the excluded
     namespace, while the full credential keeps the report the CLI prints
