# Build lumberroom for every target this machine can produce today, and write the binaries, a
# gzipped tar archive of each, and a SHA256SUMS file into a directory it names. This script never
# publishes anything: no git tag, no git push, no `gh release`. That last step stays a human
# decision once the binaries exist.
#
#   ./scripts/cli-release.sh              # dry run: prints the plan, builds nothing
#   ./scripts/cli-release.sh --build      # builds every target this machine can reach
#   ./scripts/cli-release.sh --build --linux-only
#   ./scripts/cli-release.sh --build --out /path/to/dir
#
# Each target produces two artifacts: the bare binary (lumberroom-X.Y.Z-<target>, for a container
# that wants one file with nothing to untar) and an archive of the same name with .tar.gz appended.
# The archive holds the binary renamed to the plain `lumberroom` PATH name, plus LICENSE and
# README.md from the repository root, because that is the shape Homebrew's formula expects: it
# downloads and unpacks the tarball, and whatever comes out lands on PATH under that name.
# SHA256SUMS covers both the bare binaries and the archives, since a formula needs the archive's
# checksum and this file is where every checksum here already lives.
#
# Two build paths, because they need different toolchains:
#
#   linux (musl)   goes through the lumberroom-builder image, the same one ./scripts/cargo.sh uses.
#                  musl-tools and the x86_64 mingw-free cross gcc are not baked into that image
#                  today, so this script installs them inside the container on every run. The
#                  scout's run measured 188s total for the apt install plus both builds (59.1s
#                  and 68.4s), so roughly 60s of that is the repeated toolchain install, paid
#                  again each time. Baking it into Dockerfile.builder would remove the repeat
#                  cost; that file belongs to another owner, so it stays a wire-in rather than an
#                  edit here.
#   darwin         needs a host Rust toolchain. There is no cross-compiler for it in the
#                  container (no osxcross, no zig here), so this script shells out to the host's
#                  own `cargo` and `rustup`, not docker. On a machine with neither, both darwin
#                  targets are skipped with the command that would unblock them, and the script
#                  still exits 0: a partial release for the targets that ARE buildable here is the
#                  point of this script running locally at all, with CI (cli-release.yml) covering
#                  the rest.
#
# Windows is never attempted. crates/lumberroom resolves its config path from $HOME with no
# %USERPROFILE% fallback and `restrict()` no-ops outside unix, so a Windows binary today would
# write an unprotected token file. Fix config.rs first.
#
# Archiving runs on whatever tar is on this host's PATH: bsdtar on macOS, GNU tar on Linux. Both
# get --format=ustar plus zeroed owner/group and a fixed mtime on every staged file, and the
# archive is piped through `gzip -n` so the gzip header carries no timestamp or filename either;
# that makes two runs of the same commit produce identical bytes ON THE SAME TAR. It was verified
# by running bsdtar twice in a row and comparing output byte for byte. It was NOT verified across
# bsdtar and GNU tar: pax/ustar implementations differ enough between libarchive and GNU tar
# (padding, extended-header handling) that --format=ustar narrows the gap but does not close it
# for certain, and this machine has no GNU tar to check against. Treat cross-flavour byte parity
# as unverified, not achieved.

  --linux-only   skip the darwin leg (the two musl targets only).
  --darwin-only  skip the linux leg (the two darwin targets only, host toolchain required).
