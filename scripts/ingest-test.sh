# SAFETY, and it is the reason this script stands up its own everything. `ingest plan` opens a run
# row on the server before it reads a byte, and `ingest submit` moves watermarks. Both are writes.
# So this script never talks to the owner's server and never opens the owner's database: it starts
# a scratch server on --port (default 8789, never 8787) against a database named lumberroom_ingest_test,
# mints two throwaway credentials for the run, and drops both on exit. LUMBERROOM_URL and LUMBERROOM_TOKEN in
# the environment are ignored on purpose; there is no flag that points this at a live deployment.
#
# The transcripts it reads are fixtures it writes itself under target/ingest-test-work, reached
# through LUMBERROOM_CLAUDE_ROOT. The owner's ~/.claude/projects is never walked.
#
# Flags:
#   --port N   the scratch server's port. Default 8789. 8787 is refused.
#   --keep     leave the container and lumberroom_ingest_test in place for inspection.
#
# LUMBERROOM_CLI, if set, is a path to a lumberroom binary that runs on this host, and every step runs
# through it directly. Unset, the script builds crates/lumberroom in the builder image and runs the
# binary inside a container on the compose network. On macOS that is the only mode that works:
# target/release/lumberroom is a Linux ELF.
#
# Follows the house shape in policy-test.sh and correction-test.sh: PASS and FAIL lines, a counter,
# a summary, a non-zero exit on any failure. There is no SKIP. Every step below is decidable
# against a server this script controls, and a harness that can skip is a harness that reports
# success while testing nothing.

say "what each step proved"
cat <<SUMMARY
  1  a digest entry cuts nothing, and the text-level backstop counts the entry it dropped
  2  an attachment is excluded whatever its subtype, and an unmet subtype is counted rather than
     passed over
  3  a tool_result joined to a memory tool is excluded, its text is nowhere in the run directory,
     and a Read result still reaches the chunk an extractor is handed
  4  a file under a sensitive directory is skipped by name, never opened, and never quoted
  5  a submit advances the watermark, and the plan after it re-reads none of the same bytes
  6  ingest list answers for a credential with mayIngest and refuses one without it
