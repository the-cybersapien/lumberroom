# Read-only. It writes nothing to the store and needs no capability beyond the one every credential
# has. Run it after every deploy and after every change to PUBLIC_URL, AUTH_TOKENS or the image.
#
# Four failures on this box are invisible to `curl /healthz`, and each has cost real time:
#
#   rmcp validates the Host header against an allowlist derived from PUBLIC_URL. Left wrong, a
#   deployment answers every health check and metadata document while refusing every MCP request
#   with a 403 the client reports as a connection failure. Step 4 is the only one that catches it,
#   because it makes a real tool call rather than asking whether the port is open.
#
#   KEK_PROVIDER can be configured and the key still not be the one the existing rows were sealed
#   with. The server boots, serves, and refuses every private write. Step 2 reads the flag.
#
#   An issuer that disagrees with the host behind a reverse proxy stays invisible until a real
#   client's discovery fails. Step 6 compares the documents against the URL you asked about.
#
#   `docker restart` reuses the container's original image, and so does `docker compose up -d` in
#   some cases, so a rebuilt image sits on disk while the old binary keeps serving. Step 3 compares
#   the sha the running binary was built from against the one you expect, which defaults to HEAD in
#   this checkout.
