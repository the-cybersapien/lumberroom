# Traps

Findings that cost real time to get. Each one arrived as a passing test, a plausible number, or a
silent wrong answer, which is why they are written down rather than left for the next person to
re-derive. Where a longer write-up exists with its evidence, the entry links it.

## Retrieval and the database

**HNSW silently truncates a filtered search.** `hnsw.iterative_scan` defaults to off, and every
search here filters by namespace. Reproduced at 40k rows with a namespace holding 0.5% of them: a
query asking for 10 rows returned zero, because the scan pulled 40 candidates and the filter removed
all 40. The caller was told nothing is known. Migration `003` sets `strict_order` and `ef_search=100`
on the database so the setting travels with the schema; never remove or override it.
[`research/pgvector-at-scale.md`](research/pgvector-at-scale.md).

**A Postgres `tsvector` is not an index over the document, it is the document, stemmed.** So private
content drops out of lexical search and becomes semantic-only, and the GIN index is partial on
`sensitivity = 'open'`. The embedding stays plaintext and leaks the gist, which
[decision 0005](decisions/0005-private-drops-lexical-search.md) states rather than hides.

**`SET LOCAL` on a pooled connection with no transaction open is a warning and no effect.**
`nearest_ids(exact)` ran `SET LOCAL enable_indexscan = off` that way, so every "exact ground truth"
scan went through HNSW and the recall monitor compared the index against itself for a whole phase.
It could not have caught the truncation failure it existed to catch. Wrap it in a transaction. On a
pool you never know whether one is open.

**At `k=1` the planner declines the HNSW index**, so both arms of the monitor run sequentially and
report a self-comparison a second way, unrelated to the `SET LOCAL` bug.
[`research/recall-monitor.md`](research/recall-monitor.md) carries the method.

**Migrations are forward-only.** `sqlx` embeds them at compile time, so once a newer binary has
migrated a store, an older image cannot boot against it. Plan rollbacks as forward migrations.

**A window that filters both sides of a pair comparison misses the commonest duplicate there is.** A
new row restating an old fact gives one new row and one old one. Anchor on what changed and compare
against every live row. `similar_pairs` does, and a test asserts the `OR` that makes it so.

**A run that finds nothing still has to advance its watermark.** Set the mark from the candidates and
a quiet run advances nothing, so every later run re-reads the same rows forever. `newest_in_scope`
exists for that.

## Policy and disclosure

**Four disclosures shipped, and no gate could have caught them.** Each published a value computed
before the grant ran, or after only one of the two axes: a client name from `/statsz`, a 60-character
excerpt from `/admin/recall`, unfiltered counts in the digest inventory, and namespace names in
`also_searched`. The suites assert that a nonce is absent, and none of those four is a nonce.
`policy-test.sh` now asserts the class. Five of the new tests were validated by reverting the fix and
watching them fail, because a test written after a fix that never saw the bug is not evidence.

**The digest has seven grant-filtered subqueries, not five.** `DIGEST_SQL` in
`src/adapters/postgres/memory.rs` is one round trip on purpose, and every arm joins `reachable` and
compares `sensitivity_rank`. The two a reviewer misses are the registry arms, and the registry holds
credential locations. Unit tests count the `JOIN reachable rg` and `<= rg.max_rank` occurrences, so
adding an arm moves the counts and you update the test on purpose.

**`namespace_counts` keeps an unfiltered signature.** A glob grant resolves against concrete names,
so discovery has to run before the grant can. The port documents the contract: neither its counts nor
its names may reach a response as they stand.

**Empty plaintext is never a comparison.** A private neighbour arrives from the repository with
`content == ""`, and a collapse guard run against an empty string passes for any text without digits,
identifiers or negations. `src/services/write.rs` decrypts every empty-content candidate before the
bands run.

**An alias resolved from one side only.** The group lookup keyed on `namespace = $2`, and an alias
row lives in whichever namespace the writer typed. Measured on a real store: 8 hits one way, 4 the
other, `also_searched: []`, no error. The scope is the prefix now, so `project:` covers every project
namespace and `personal:warden` stays a different subject.

**Recall reinforces itself into duplication.** One audited store held the same preference 808 times,
because recalled memories were re-extracted as new ones by a capture hook with no matcher. Anything
that writes back from context has to exclude what the digest and search put there. The whole
ingestion design is arranged around this.

**Switching `KEK_PROVIDER` from `none` to a key changes every content digest.**
`recall_emission.content_sha256` and `ingest_proposal.fingerprint` are HMACs under a key derived
from the KEK (`crypto::digest`); with no KEK they are plain SHA-256. Emissions and proposals
recorded before the switch never meet the ones recorded after, so the echo check answers false
for old emissions and a rejected proposal re-proposes once. Run migration 000017's `DELETE` by hand
after the switch if the stale rows bother you. Migration 000009's column comment still describes
the unkeyed hash; migrations are forward-only, so `crypto/digest.rs` is the description that holds.

## Protocol and auth

**`rmcp` validates the `Host` header against an allowlist defaulting to loopback only.** A deployment
reached at its real domain answers every health check, every metadata document and every operator
endpoint while refusing every MCP request with a 403 the client reports as a connection failure.
Nothing local reproduces it. `allowed_hosts` in `src/http/mod.rs` derives the list from `PUBLIC_URL`
plus the loopback names, and an entry with no port matches any port, which keeps it working behind a
proxy terminating on 443.

**`rmcp` defaults to legacy session mode**, and sessions left MCP in the 2026-07-28 revision. The
transport is built from `Default` and adjusted, because the config is `#[non_exhaustive]`. It also
injects the whole `http::request::Parts` into the tool context rather than copying axum extensions
onto it, so middleware state lives one level in: `rc.extensions.get::<Parts>()` then
`parts.extensions.get::<Principal>()`.

**`#[tool_handler]` without `router = self.tool_router` builds a fresh router on every call.** It
carries only the first `#[tool_router]` block, so a second block's tools list correctly and answer
`tool not found`. The bare form looks right and compiles.

**RFC 7636 defaults an omitted `code_challenge_method` to `plain`, not S256.** The missing case is
refused rather than read charitably, and metadata advertises `["S256"]` alone.

**An OAuth loopback redirect port has to be persisted, not ephemeral.** Migration 007 compares
`redirect_uri` exactly and never prefix-matches, so a client that binds port 0 registers one port and
comes back on another. The second login fails where the first worked.

**The published wire contract is snake_case throughout and pinned by a test.** A rename on the domain
side once turned every latency field into `-ms` with nothing failing.

## Build and containers

**A cache mount is not part of the image.** Binaries have to be copied to a real path inside the same
`RUN`. A later stage reading `/build/target` finds an empty directory.

**Adding a stage at the end of a Dockerfile changes what an untargeted build produces.** Both compose
services name their `target:` for that reason.

**`COPY` preserves source mtimes.** With a `fn main() {}` stub used for dependency caching, cargo
skipped the real rebuild and the image shipped a 325KB binary with an empty `/models`, passing every
check at a plausible 118MB. Cache mounts do the job now. Any scheme that fakes a source tree to warm
the cache needs an assertion on the built artefact.

**`cargo build --release` at a workspace root builds only the root package.** The image shipped no
client while the size assertion passed on the binary that did get built. Pass `--workspace`.

**`docker run --rm` does not remove a container when the client is killed.** The container keeps
running and keeps cargo's build lock, and every later run blocks on it. `scripts/cargo.sh` sweeps by
owner pid.

**`docker restart` reuses the container's original image**, and so does `docker compose up -d` in
some cases. `--force-recreate` picks up a rebuild. Nothing in the product reports that a running
server is behind the image on disk.

**Compose interpolates every service whether or not its profile is active.** A `${VAR:?...}` on a
profile-gated service breaks `docker compose up -d db` for a deployment that never wanted it.

**Compose `secrets:` ignores `uid`, `gid` and `mode`.** Those fields are Swarm-only. Under plain
`docker compose` the file lands root-owned at 0444 while `docker compose config` prints a
resolved-looking value that was never applied, and `src/crypto/kek.rs` refuses a key file readable by
group or other. The KEK is a plain bind mount. Docker Desktop's virtiofs also reports bind-mounted
files as root inside the container whatever the host-side ownership says.

**A Docker bind mount does not reliably show a host directory deleted and recreated at the same
path.** Measured while fixing `scripts/ingest-test.sh`: a container started right after `rm -rf` then
`mkdir` saw an empty directory on four tries out of six, while twelve tries at twelve distinct paths
were all correct. Two harness steps read a corpus of zero files and still passed their assertions.
Give every case a fresh path.

**The image is large because of model selection.** `EmbeddingModel::BGEBaseENV15Q` resolves to
`model_optimized.onnx` at roughly 2 bytes per parameter, which is fp16 rather than int8: 209MB of
weights against a 35MB binary. The earlier explanation blamed `COPY` dereferencing the HuggingFace
cache's symlinks, and that was checked against the built image and is wrong.

## Tests

**A test can pass against the mutation it exists to catch.** The cleanup window test ran through
`cleanup::run`, where a different query was quietly finding the pair. Assert at the layer that owns
the property, and check by mutating the code rather than by reading it.

**A mutex serialises threads, not processes.** Six test binaries sharing one database each had their
own `static SERIAL`, so one binary truncated the table another was asserting against. Every file
passed alone and two failed in a full run, with assertions that read like logic bugs.
`tests/common/mod.rs` takes a Postgres advisory lock, which the session holds and every process sees.
The guard has to be carried out of `setup`; an unused-variable warning was the only tell when it was
not.

**The integration suite skips rather than fails with no database reachable**, so a run reporting a low
count is not a pass. Check the split, not the exit code.

**A test that works around the bug reads as coverage.** The alias test called `put_alias` once per
namespace, which is the only way the old one-sided lookup answered from every side. A feature that
works when you record it three times is not working.

**`services::write::run` collapses a near-identical write**, so a duplicate cannot be made through it.
Every duplicate in a real store arrived some other way, and a test that writes one through the normal
path is testing nothing.

**Two rows with identical normalised text also sit at a cosine of 1.0**, so the same pair queues once
as `exact` and once as `paraphrase` under two cluster keys. `scripts/cleanup-test.sh` caught it and
nothing else did.

**`s.index("#[cfg(test)]")` finds the first occurrence, not the module's own test block.** A Python
slice built that way to split a Rust file at its test module duplicated 374 lines, because an inner
`#[cfg(test)]` attribute (on a helper, not the trailing `mod tests`) appeared earlier in the file
than the block the slice was meant to isolate. Anchor on the last occurrence, or on the attribute
immediately preceding `mod tests`. Landed 24 August 2026.

## Shell, config and rendering

**Two `.env` quoting traps fail in opposite directions.** Shell scripts that source `.env` with `sh`
strip double quotes, so `AUTH_TOKENS` in its JSON form turns invalid and `["*"]` becomes a glob `sh`
tries to expand. Docker Compose instead expands `$` inside env files, and an argon2 PHC string is
almost entirely `$` segments, so an unquoted `OWNER_PASSWORD_HASH` reaches the server mangled and
every login answers 500. Single-quote every value.

**A `#` comment after a line continuation inside `RUN` comments out the rest of the command.**

**GNU `stat` reads `-f` as `--file-system`.** `stat -f %m || stat -c %Y` returns a filesystem block
count concatenated with the real epoch, and the arithmetic dies under `set -u`. Every macOS run
passed; a review that ran the script in a debian container found it.

**A rendered CSS class with no rule is invisible to every other check.** The contradiction controls
shipped unusable while the handler, the markup and the tests were all correct.

**Duplicated navigation drifts.** The console nav existed in three hardcoded copies, so a new tab
appeared on one page and not the others. One `pages::nav` now.

**`text-decoration` on an ancestor paints through inline descendants.** A `line-through` on a
container struck out a nested span meant to explain the strike, so the explanation itself read as
crossed out. Set `text-decoration: none` on the child; the decoration does not stop at an element
boundary on its own. Landed 24 August 2026.

## Crate specifics

[`rust-spike-findings.md`](rust-spike-findings.md) carries these with the spike that established them. sqlx and pgvector
must resolve the same sqlx version, and pgvector's sqlx support rides an implicit feature absent from
its manifest. fastembed's `embed` takes `&mut self` and is CPU-bound, so the adapter locks and uses
`spawn_blocking`. ONNX Runtime links statically, so the runtime image needs no `.so`. sqlx 0.9's
`query()` takes `impl SqlSafeStr`, which only `&'static str` satisfies, so every statement spells its
columns out rather than sharing a constant.

The embedding weights differ from the pre-rewrite TypeScript build: fastembed pulls
`Qdrant/bge-base-en-v1.5-onnx-Q`, the old build used `Xenova/bge-base-en-v1.5` at q8. Same family,
same 768 dimensions, not provably the same quantised weights. `memory.embedding_model` records which
produced each row, so a mixed store is detectable.
