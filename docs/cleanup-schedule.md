# The cleanup schedule

Two halves, two processes, no cron anywhere.

**The deterministic pass runs inside the server**, on a timer set by `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECS`
(default 3600, `0` turns it off). Exact duplicates and near-certain pairs, written straight into the
queue. It opens no connection to anyone. Nothing to install: it starts with the server and stops
with it, and one task cannot overlap itself, so it needs no lock.

**The model pass runs as its own container**, `lumberroom cleanup daemon`, under the `cleanup` compose
profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile cleanup up -d
```

`restart: unless-stopped` is the whole scheduler. No cron daemon, no crontab, no host dependency,
and the same `docker compose up -d` that starts everything else.

## Why two processes

This is a boundary rather than a packaging choice. The server holds the key-encryption key, and
[decision 0011](decisions/0011-cleanup-proposes.md) keeps the provider call out of that process, so
no outbound connection to a third party is ever opened from the one holding the key. The daemon
calls a provider and holds no key material of the store's.

The daily run sends open-row text to a provider. The in-server pass sends nothing anywhere.

## Why a wall clock rather than an interval

The daemon sleeps until the next occurrence of `CLEANUP_DAILY_AT` and not for twenty-four hours from
process start. An interval fires the moment the process comes up, so a container in a crash loop
spends the model call on every restart, and a container restarted at noon quietly moves the nightly
run to noon. Waking on the clock keeps the schedule where you put it.

## Settings

| variable | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECS` | `3600` | seconds between in-server passes; `0` turns it off, and is the only way to |
| `CLEANUP_NAMESPACE` | every namespace | a glob to narrow the in-server pass to |
| `CLEANUP_LIMIT` | `500` | rows one in-server pass considers |
| `LUMBERROOM_CLEANUP_TOKEN` | none | a client token carrying `mayIngest` and `read` at `open` over the namespaces it cleans; the daemon refuses at startup without it |
| `CLEANUP_DAILY_AT` | `04:25` | local clock time for the model pass |
| `CLEANUP_PROVIDER` | `openrouter` | `openrouter`, `zai`, `openai`, `anthropic` or `custom` |
| `CLEANUP_MODEL` | `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` | the tier that decides the undecided pairs |
| `CLEANUP_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.65` | the floor for the band the model is asked about |

The provider key comes from `ZAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`, passed to the container
as `LUMBERROOM_INGEST_KEY_<PROVIDER>`. It never reaches a command line.

## The daemon's grant

The token in `LUMBERROOM_CLEANUP_TOKEN` carries `mayIngest` and a `read` list of the namespaces the
daemon cleans, at `open`, and nothing else:

```json
{"client":"cleanup","token":"...","read":[{"namespace":"*","max":"open"}],"write":[],"mayIngest":true}
```

`mayIngest` opens the routes; the `read` list is what the run reads. A run with no `--namespace`
covers the grant, a `--namespace` outside it is refused, and the server applies the grant inside
the candidate queries rather than over the result. `open` is the right ceiling because every pair
the daemon is handed goes to a provider, and the run withholds a pair with a side above `open`
under any grant, so a higher ceiling buys the daemon no findings and hands the token private rows
through every other route. The daemon never writes a memory row and never applies a finding, so it
holds no `write` and no `mayDelete`. [`docs/permissions.md`](permissions.md) covers what `mayIngest`
opens and why it is off by default.

The ceiling also bounds the deterministic half of the daemon's run: an HTTP run groups exact and
near-certain duplicates only among rows its grant admits, so the daemon never groups two private
rows. The in-server pass does, unrestricted, because nothing it reads leaves the machine. Setting
`CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECS=0` switches that pass off and leaves private duplicates ungrouped; widen the
daemon's ceiling only if you have done that and accept a provider-facing token that can read
private rows.

## What a failed night looks like

The daemon logs the failure and waits for tomorrow. It does not exit: a schedule that stops because
a provider was down for one night is worse than one night with no pass, and nobody finds out until
they go looking. `docker compose logs cleanup` shows every run and every failure.

It refuses two things at startup rather than at 04:25 the next day: a missing credential, and a
`--at` that is not a 24-hour clock time.

## Running either half by hand

```bash
docker compose exec cleanup lumberroom cleanup run --no-model   # the deterministic half
docker compose exec cleanup lumberroom cleanup run              # and the model pass with it
```

There is no cron anywhere and no script to install. `deploy/install.sh` mints the `cleanup` client
and writes `LUMBERROOM_CLEANUP_TOKEN` into `.env`, so turning the profile on is the only remaining step.

## One project on its own cadence


There is nothing to set up per project, on purpose. Grouping is scoped to a namespace inside the
query the pass runs, on both the exact and the cosine side, and one run walks every namespace the
caller's grant admits, so the shared schedule already clusters within each project rather than
across them. A fact restated under a second namespace is not a finding.

To narrow the in-server pass to one project, set `CLEANUP_NAMESPACE=project:lumberroom` and restart. To
run one project on demand, on any cadence:

```bash
docker compose exec cleanup lumberroom cleanup run --namespace project:lumberroom --no-model
```
