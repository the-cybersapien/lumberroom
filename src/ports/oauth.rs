//! Storage for the built-in authorization server (decision 0002).
//!
//! Access tokens are opaque and stored hashed, so the two operations that matter are a hash lookup
//! on every request and a single UPDATE to revoke. Codes and refresh tokens are single use, and the
//! two "consume" operations below must be atomic: a replayed code or a replayed refresh token is
//! the signal that a credential leaked, and detecting it requires the check and the mark to be one
//! statement rather than a read followed by a write.
