//! Which grant each tool needs, and the filter that keeps a tool out of the list a client reads.
//!
//! One table, two readers. `list_tools` filters on it so a model never sees a tool it cannot call,
//! and the documentation in `docs/permissions.md` is generated against the same names. A mapping
//! that lives in the filter alone is a mapping the docs go stale against on the first edit.
//!
//! **The filter is not the enforcement.** Every service checks the grant again on the call. This
//! shapes what a model tries; `forget::by_id`, `services::history` and `registry::set` are what
//! refuse it. A client that hard-codes a tool name and calls it directly gets a 403 either way,
//! which is the property that matters and the one a filter alone would not give.
