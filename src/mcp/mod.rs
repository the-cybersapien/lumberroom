//! MCP surface: the four tools from PRD §5, plus five behind a capability each.
//!
//! `src/mcp/capability.rs` holds which grant opens which tool, and `list_tools` filters on it so a
//! client never sees a tool it cannot call. The filter shapes what a model tries; every service
//! checks the grant again on the call, which is what refuses a client that names a tool anyway.
//!
//! Descriptions are written as instructions rather than blurbs. They are the only lever that makes
//! a model read memory before working and write memory after learning something (PRD §6.4), and on
//! every surface except OpenWebUI they are the only lever at all. Signatures extend and never
//! rename: a client pinned to an older argument list keeps working, and a renamed tool is a tool the
//! model has to be told about again.
