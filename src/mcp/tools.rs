//! The valid-time argument on `memory_write`: its wording, and the parser that enforces it.
//!
//! The wording is the control. Nothing in the write path calls a model to extract a date, so the
//! only thing standing between a useful `occurred_at` column and a column full of today's date is
//! the sentence a model reads before it fills the argument in. Decision 0008 refuses date
//! extraction; what this argument carries is the user's own statement, relayed. The line runs
//! between transcribing a date the user said and inventing one from content.
//!
//! `OCCURRED_AT_DESCRIPTION` is the source of that sentence. The doc comment on
//! `WriteArgs::occurred_at` has to match it word for word, and a test compares the generated JSON
//! schema against this constant so an edit to either one fails rather than drifting.
//!
//! **`memory_search` took an `as_of` argument on 25 August 2026, reversing the refusal that used to
//! sit here.** The old reason was sound and too broad: a model turning a question into a date is
//! guessing, a hard filter drops the right row when the guess is wrong, and the store then answers
//! "nothing is known" about a fact it holds. That failure is real and `AS_OF_DESCRIPTION` names it
//! in the words the model reads, which is the only lever there is. What the refusal also blocked
//! was the person who states a time outright, and no surface could reach the as-of query at all:
//! every caller passed `None`, so a whole column of behaviour had no way to be exercised.
//!
//! The narrowing that makes it safe is not in this file. `services::search` gates `as_of` on
//! `may_read_history` before the statement runs, and refuses it beside `include_superseded`.
//! Decision 0014 carries the argument.
