//! Is this a question search can answer, or one that needs a walk?
//!
//! A walk is expensive. The first one measured cost 2,539 edge lookups and returned 256 rows out of
//! roughly 447 readable, against one statement for an ordinary search. Routing every question
//! through that replaces a cheap read with an expensive one for the large majority of questions that
//! never needed a join, so something has to decide.
//!
//! # Not a model, and not yet
//!
//! This reads the scores search already produced. Nothing here calls a provider, and that is the
//! point of starting here rather than with a classifier: the signal turned up in the measurements
//! that motivated the graph, so it can be checked before anything is trained.
//!
//! Two runs on 25 August 2026, same store, same ranker:
//!
//! - A question naming an entity the store holds returned that row first at **0.834**, with the
//!   next hit at 0.704. Sharp.
//! - The compositional question that needed the graph topped out at **0.570** and reached 0.512 at
//!   rank twenty, with unrelated rows scoring what the right one would have. Flat.
//!
//! A low best score beside a flat distribution is the shape of a question similarity cannot answer.
//! It says the store holds nothing that looks like the question, and that several things look
//! equally unlike it, which is what a join looks like from inside a single-vector search.
//!
//! # The thresholds are guesses, and they are meant to be replaced
//!
//! They are set from two observations. Two is not a calibration. This is the same position 0011 took
//! on the dedupe bands: publish the signal per decision, let the owner read real ones with their
//! numbers beside them, and move the thresholds when there is something to move them with.
//! [`Signals`] rides on every verdict for that reason, so a run over real questions is a calibration
//! run rather than an exercise to build later.
//!
//! # The thresholds are cosine values, and only cosine values
//!
//! Both numbers are absolute scores from the linear blend, where a good hit sits near 0.8 and a poor
//! one near 0.5. Under rank fusion the same hit scores about `1/(k + rank)`, so a rank-one row is
//! near 0.016 and the whole field spans less than 0.01. Compared against these thresholds every
//! question would read weak *and* flat, and every question would walk: the opposite of what this
//! module is for, arrived at silently.
//!
//! So the router declines to decide under a blend it was not calibrated against, and says so. It
//! does not invent a second pair of numbers, because there is no run behind them and a guessed
//! threshold that routes traffic is worse than no router at all.
//!
//! # Bias
//!
//! Toward not walking. A false negative costs the answer search would have given anyway, which is
//! the answer the caller gets today. A false positive costs thousands of edge lookups and hands back
//! half the store. The cheap failure is the one to prefer while the numbers are guesses.
