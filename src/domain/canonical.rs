//! Canonical registry keys (Phase 2 spec §4).
//!
//! Six writers without a scheme produce `desktop.gpu`, `machines.desktop.gpu` and
//! `hardware.desktop.gpu` for one fact. The PRD is explicit that preventing that beats cleaning it
//! up, so a key is checked on write against a fixed shape and a closed domain vocabulary.
//!
//! Rejection alone is not enough. A model that gets a bare error invents a third variant rather
//! than the canonical name, which is why every rejection carries the closest valid key and why the
//! caller records the rejected guess as an alias. That turns each naming mistake into a one-line
//! redirect instead of a duplicate fact.
//!
//! Three outcomes, and the line between them is the whole design:
//!
//! 1. **Repaired silently.** Surrounding whitespace, upper case, repeated dots, dash runs, and
//!    separator characters. These are mechanical: every variant lands on one key, no word changes,
//!    and there is nothing for the caller to decide.
//! 2. **Rejected with a suggestion.** A domain outside the vocabulary, a singular domain, a
//!    pluralised attribute, a missing domain. Each of these repairs guesses at intent, and a guess
//!    belongs in the alias table where it is visible, not applied silently to a write. Accepting a
//!    near-miss quietly is how the scheme stops meaning anything.
//! 3. **Rejected with nothing.** Empty, one segment, five segments, non-ascii, a leading or
//!    trailing dot. There is no reading of these with one plausible answer, and a wrong suggestion
//!    recorded as an alias is worse than no suggestion.
//!
//! No I/O. The alias table, the registry rows and the transport all live elsewhere.
