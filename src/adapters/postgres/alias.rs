/// Every name in the group of `$3`, including `$3` itself.
///
/// # The lookup spans the prefix, not the one namespace
///
/// A group is a set of namespaces: `project:warden`, `project:quill` and `project:lumen` are one
/// subject under three names. The row recording that lives in whichever namespace the owner typed
/// when he wrote it, so keying the lookup on `namespace = $2` made the group findable from that
/// side and no other. Recorded under `project:lumen`, a search in `project:lumen` expanded to
/// warden and quill, and a search in `project:warden` expanded to nothing. Observed on the owner's
/// own store: 8 hits one way, 4 the other, with no error and no tell.
///
/// So the scope is the prefix. `project:` matches every project namespace and nothing outside it,
/// which is the boundary a rename actually respects: `personal:warden` is a different subject from
/// `project:warden` and stays one. A namespace with no colon falls back to matching itself, since
/// there is no prefix to widen to.
///
/// The first arm resolves the name asked for to its canonical name, or keeps it when the name is
/// canonical already or unknown. The second arm collects every other name pointing at that
/// canonical. The `COALESCE` is what makes the statement total: an unknown name still produces one
/// row, so a caller substituting the result into a search never gets an empty list and never
/// searches for nothing.
///
/// One hop, no recursion, because a canonical name is never itself an alias. `put` holds that
/// invariant by repointing a group when its canonical name is renamed. A bounded recursive CTE
/// would also terminate, and it would terminate by truncating a chain longer than the bound with no
/// error, which is this system's worst failure dressed as a depth limit.
///
/// `since` and `until` are read by nobody here on purpose. Warden stopped being the current name in
/// March and the Warden facts are still in the store, so a group that dropped retired names would
/// expand a query into exactly the set that finds nothing.
