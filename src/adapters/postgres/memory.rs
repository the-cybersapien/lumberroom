//! Postgres implementation of MemoryRepository.
//!
//! All memory SQL lives here. Callers ask for ranked results; how they are ranked is this file's
//! business, which is the seam that makes a second storage implementation possible.
//!
//! Two rules run through every statement below.
//!
//! **The sensitivity ceiling is part of the query.** The caller hands over namespaces paired with
//! the ceiling it holds for each, they arrive as two parallel arrays, and every subquery joins
//! against them. A row this client may not see never enters this client's process memory, which is
//! a stronger guarantee than filtering results and is the only one worth having.
//!
//! **The repository never encrypts and never decrypts.** A private row arrives with its ciphertext
//! already sealed by the service and leaves as a `Memory` with an empty `content`. The KEK lives in
//! the service layer and nothing here can reach it, so no statement in this file can accidentally
//! turn ciphertext into a plaintext column or hand ciphertext bytes to a caller as if they were
//! text.

/// in reverse, towards the first version. Both are depth-capped for the reason the other walks are:
/// a cycle already in the table would otherwise run until the statement timeout.
///
/// Depth is the ordering and the answer is read from it. Negating the backward leg puts the oldest
/// version at the most negative depth, the anchor at zero and the live row last, so `ORDER BY depth`
/// says "was 8080, then 8787" without comparing dates that may be NULL. `created_at` and `id` break
/// the tie, because a row that retired two predecessors gives the backward walk two rows at one
/// depth and an unordered answer is a different timeline on every call.
///
/// `min(depth)` collapses the union to one row per id. A chain with no cycle gives the anchor twice
/// at zero and everything else once; a chain with a cycle gives an id several depths, and one row
/// per id beats a timeline that lists the same version four times.
///
/// **The walk crosses namespaces and the grant filters the rows.** `write::run` permits a
/// supersede whose successor sits in another namespace, so a real chain can cross one. A walk
/// scoped to a single namespace stopped at that boundary and handed back a short history with
/// nothing saying so, which is the same failure as filtering inside the recursion and arrives
/// through the other axis. Both axes now filter at the final join and neither steers the walk.
///
/// Filtering either axis inside the recursion would sever the chain at the first row the caller
/// may not read and hide every version behind it, reporting a partial timeline as a complete one.
/// Filtering here drops that version, keeps the versions past it, and counts what was dropped, so
/// the gap is something the caller is told about rather than something they cannot see.
///
/// **The grant is matched in SQL, which is the one place in this file that has to be.** Every
/// other read resolves globs to concrete namespaces with `policy::resolve` before the query runs.
/// That is impossible here: which namespaces a chain visits is the answer, not the question, so
/// there is nothing to resolve the globs against until the walk has already run. The `EXISTS` is
/// `policy::admits` spelled in SQL, union across matching patterns like `policy::ceiling`, and
/// `split_grants` below turns each pattern into the prefix comparison that mirrors
/// `namespaces::matches`. The digest's `min()` collapse is a different rule for a different input:
/// it deduplicates already-resolved concrete ceilings.
///
/// The anchor is gated on being readable itself. Without that, a caller naming an id they may not
/// read would learn the shape of its chain from the rows around it, where the contract says an id
