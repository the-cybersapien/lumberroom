//! Clients in the console: who may reach this store, what they may do, and how to stop them.
//!
//! Until this page, adding a surface meant editing `AUTH_TOKENS` on the box and restarting, or
//! waiting for a client to register itself and then approving it at the consent screen. Neither is
//! something to do from a phone, and the first is the reason a store ends up with one credential
//! doing everything: the cost of a second one is an SSH session.
//!
//! # These are OAuth clients, not bearer tokens
//!
//! A client created here goes in `oauth_client` beside the ones that register themselves, and it
//! completes the OAuth flow to get its own tokens. Nothing here mints a bearer token, and
//! `AUTH_TOKENS` is untouched: a credential the owner put in `.env` keeps working exactly as it
//! did, because auth modes compose rather than exclude.
//!
//! # Creating a client consents to it
//!
//! `set_client_grant` writes `consented_at` alongside the grant, and that is the right reading
//! here. Consent exists so a grant is one the owner approved rather than one a client asked for;
//! an owner filling in this form behind his own password has approved it more directly than a
//! consent screen ever asks. A client that registers itself still goes to that screen, because
//! nobody approved that one yet.
//!
//! # The secret is shown once
//!
//! Confidential clients get a secret at creation and the store keeps only `hash_token` of it, so
//! nothing can show it again. Losing it means issuing another client. That is stricter than
//! `AUTH_TOKENS`, which holds its tokens in plaintext in `.env`, and the difference is deliberate:
//! a console reachable from a browser must not be a place every credential can be read out of.
//!
//! # Access is editable after the fact
//!
//! Most clients arrive by registering themselves and consenting, so the grant they end up with is
//! whatever the consent screen offered on the day. Until this page the only ways to change it were
//! to send the client back through the flow, which only the client can start, or to revoke it and
//! issue another. Each client here carries its own copy of the same form the create form uses, and
//! saving it writes the grant through `set_client_grant`.
//!
//! A change lands on the client's next call. `OpaqueTokenAuthenticator` reads the grant off the
//! client row for every request rather than off the token, so nothing has to reconnect and no
//! token has to be reissued.
//!
//! # Scope is a list of namespaces, not a grammar
//!
//! The grant language is globs with a ceiling each, and asking for it in a text box is how a form
//! gets answered by copying whatever the last client had. The shape says what a client may do and
//! how deep it may see; the scope says where. Picking `project:sivella` and `user:me` off the list
//! rewrites the shape's `*` into those two names at the level the shape already chose, so the
//! common request, one client that only sees one project, is two clicks and no syntax.
//!
//! The namespaces offered are the ones the store actually holds, plus any the client already
//! reaches, so a grant written before a namespace was emptied still shows its own name ticked. The
//! text box beside them takes anything the list cannot: a namespace with nothing in it yet, or a
//! glob like `project:*`.
//!
//! # Revoking is one click and no confirmation
//!
//! Deleting a memory asks first because the owner can miss what is gone. Revoking a client is the
//! opposite: the cost of a mistake is a surface that stops working and says so, and the cost of
//! hesitating is a credential still live while you look for the confirm button.
