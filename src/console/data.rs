//! What a page needs, assembled from the ports and the services.
//!
//! Nothing here renders. Every value a page prints is shaped here first, so the renderer holds no
//! policy decision and the decision has one place to be wrong.
//!
//! Two rules run through the file.
//!
//! **A private row is decrypted through `services::decrypt` and never a second time here.** That
//! helper opens each row once and reuses the plaintext when the same row arrives twice, which is
//! the bug that once dropped a fact from both sections it appeared in. A second decryption path in
//! this module would be a second place for that to go wrong.
//!
//! **A sealed item is counted and never opened.** The server holds no key for one by construction,
//! so the count is the whole honest answer and `Entry` carries no content for it to print.
