//! The cleanup queue in the console: what a pass thinks the store has accumulated, and the answers
//! the owner gives it.
//!
//! A pass reads the store as a whole, finds duplicates, paraphrases, contradictions and rows
//! nothing has ever read, and writes a proposal. It retires nothing. This page is where the owner
//! reads one and decides it, and every control calls the `services::cleanup` function
//! `lumberroom cleanup` calls for the same word. Decision 0006 makes that argument for the ingest
//! queue and it carries here unchanged: the handler holds no rule of its own, so a rule added on
//! this surface rather than in the service cannot exist.
//!
//! # A rejection is answerable
//!
//! `queue` counts a cluster it already holds as known in every state, rejected included, which is
//! what stops an hourly pass raising the same finding every hour. It also blocks the replacement
//! when the pass that wrote the finding was what was wrong, so the Rejected section carries one
//! control that puts a row back at `proposed`.
//!
//! # A contradiction carries no Apply
//!
//! `CleanupKind::has_keep` is false for it and `deletes` is false too, so `services::cleanup::apply`
//! refuses it with `ApplyRefusal::NothingToApply`. A page that drew the button anyway would offer a
//! control whose only outcome is a refusal page. The reason is worth printing rather than hiding:
//! which of two conflicting facts holds is the owner's call, and a pass that picked the winner
//! would be writing the fact rather than reporting the conflict.
//!
//! # The one capability, and only for the kind that needs it
//!
//! Console handlers do not go through `ingest_ctx`, so nothing upstream of this file checks a
//! capability. What decides whether the Apply button works is the principal the handler builds, and
//! `owner_approver` alone is not enough: a `stale` proposal deletes its rows through
//! `services::review::delete`, which refuses a principal with `may_delete` false. So `operator`
//! adds that flag for `Stale` and for no other kind, the shape `aliases::alias_operator` uses. A
//! blanket grant would reopen the blast radius decision 0006 settled, to buy nothing: every other
//! kind supersedes.
//!
//! # Why the page carries its own stylesheet
//!
//! `pages::STYLE` and `pages::shell` are private to that module and this file does not own it, so
//! the chrome is spelled again here, the way `aliases.rs` does. Every selector is prefixed `cl-`,
//! which makes merging this constant into `STYLE` later a paste rather than a collision hunt.
