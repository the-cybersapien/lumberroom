//! Aliases in the console: which names denote one subject, and the two acts that change that.
//!
//! Search expands a query over every name in a group, so this page is the only place the owner can
//! see why a question about Lumen came back with a fact written while the project was called
//! Warden. Recorded over HTTP and visible nowhere was the state this file ends.
//!
//! # Why the write here is an operator act
//!
//! An alias steers retrieval for every client at once. `services::alias` gates recording one on
//! `registry_write` for that reason, and the reasoning it gives is the reasoning this file follows:
//! a model that could record an alias could point a name at a subject of its choosing and change
//! what every later search returns, without any client seeing it happen. So the read on this page
//! runs as `Console::owner_reader` and the two writes run as `alias_operator`, which is that reader
//! plus the one capability the act needs.
//!
//! # Forgetting asks first
//!
//! Removing an alias narrows every future search and leaves no trace that says so. A memory
//! deleted is a row the owner can miss; a group quietly split keeps answering, with less. The
//! control posts once to draw a page naming the alias and the canonical it points at, and the same
//! token decides the second post.
//!
//! # Why the page carries its own stylesheet
//!
//! `pages::STYLE` and `pages::shell` are private to that module and this file does not own it, so
//! the chrome is spelled again here. Every selector is prefixed `al-`, which is what makes merging
//! this constant into `STYLE` later a paste rather than a collision hunt.
