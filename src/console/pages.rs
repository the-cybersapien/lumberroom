//! The console's HTML. Server-rendered, inline CSS, no JavaScript, no external asset.
//!
//! The notebook: the store reads as one document. A fact is an entry with its dateline in the left
//! margin, the prose set in a serif at reading size, and the client and the level in the right
//! margin on the same line. A correction is struck in place rather than a row that vanished.
//!
//! Three families carry the hierarchy so no level depends on lightness alone: a serif for the
//! facts, a sans for metadata and chrome, a mono for identifiers, namespaces and counts. Every
//! font is a system stack. A console that fetches a font renders wrong on the network that blocks
//! the fetch, and this one runs on a box the owner owns.
//!
//! One form writes. The compose page draws it and an entry folds it away under a summary, and both
//! render `write_form`, post to `/console/write`, and carry a token minted for that write's target.
//! A prefilled replacement is the same form with the entry's own wording in the box.
//!
//! **Every interpolated value goes through `escape`,** including memory content. A model wrote some
//! of what is stored here and a prompt-injection payload sitting in a fact has to render as text.
//! The escaper is the authorization server's, so there is one of them.
