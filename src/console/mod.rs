//! The console: somewhere to look at the store.
//!
//! One reading surface over what is already stored. A namespace index with both-axes counts, a
//! namespace as a run of entries newest first, one entry with its provenance and everything that
//! value has been, search across what the reader may see, and the registry as exact keyed facts.
//! Most pages read. Four POST routes change the store: three decide a proposal on the ingest queue,
//! and one writes a fact the owner typed.
//!
//! # Who the console is
//!
//! The owner, not a client. Every page reads with the internal principal in `owner_reader`, which
//! is built here, used here and handed to nothing outside this module. What makes that safe is the
//! session in front of it: the reader has already proved they hold the owner password, the same
//! argon2 hash that gates the OAuth consent screen, and consent is the act that hands a stranger
//! the whole store. A session good enough to approve a client is good enough to read one.
//!
//! Writing reaches for `owner_approver` instead, which is `owner_reader` plus a write grant. Every
//! write is a form POST carrying a token signed for that row and that action, so a page the owner
//! happens to be visiting cannot spend his live session on a proposal he never saw or a fact he
//! never typed.
//!
//! # What the write surface is for
//!
//! One field. `occurred_at` says when a fact started holding in the world, and a person typing it
//! knows; a model reads a date out of context and invents one, which is what the near-now fence in
//! `write::run` exists to stop. Everything else the compose page offers is what `memory_write`
//! already takes.
//!
//! The handlers hold no write logic. `services::write::run` decides classification, refuses a
//! credential, applies the fence, collapses a duplicate and links a supersession, exactly as it
//! does for a tool call. That is the property the decision to let this console write rests on, so
//! a rule added here rather than there breaks it.
//!
//! # Why it lives only in oauth mode
//!
//! `OWNER_PASSWORD_HASH` is configured and validated in that mode and in no other, and a console
//! that cannot check a password is a console with no door. In the other modes every route here
//! answers with a page saying so. The guard is one function and every handler goes through it, so
//! no route can be added that forgets. `/console/logo.svg` is the one exception, and it is
//! deliberate: the sign-in form and the consent screen link the mark as their favicon and are read
//! before any session exists.
//!
//! # The cookie
//!
//! The same signer, the same secret, the same flags, at `Path=/console`. `Sessions::set_cookie`
//! writes `Path=/oauth`, which is right for the consent flow and would leave this surface with no
//! cookie at all. Two cookies of one name at two paths are both sent, in whichever order the
//! browser chooses, and `Sessions::verify` tries every one of them, which is what makes this work
//! rather than logging the owner out at random.

// the MCP tool calls.
