//! Entry point and composition root. The only module that knows every concrete type.
//!
//! Boot order matters: config, then database, then migrations, then the schema guard, then the KEK
//! fingerprint check, then the embedder warms, and only then does the listener open. Nothing accepts
//! traffic until the model has produced a real vector, so the first tool call a model ever makes is
//! a fast one.
//!
//! The binary also carries three key-material subcommands. They live here rather than in the node
//! CLI because argon2 and CSPRNG bytes are not things a shell script should improvise, and the
//! operator needs both before the server will start in oauth mode.

// The modules live in lib.rs so the integration suite can reach them; main is the entry point.
