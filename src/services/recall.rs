//! Recall monitoring.
//!
//! HNSW is approximate and no published figure covers recall at this scale, on this hardware,
//! with this model. At tens of thousands of rows an exact scan is cheap, so ground truth is
//! always available and the honest answer is to measure rather than to trust someone else's
//! benchmark. A memory system that silently fails to return a fact it holds is worse than a slow
//! one, which is why this exists.
//!
//! Read the limits before quoting a figure from here. `nearest_ids` filters on nothing but the
//! tenant, so this measures the unfiltered index while every search a client runs filters by
//! namespace, sensitivity and supersession, which is where HNSW truncates. Probes are stored rows
//! queried with their own text, so a figure describes self-retrieval and not the retrieval a
//! question gets. `docs/research/recall-monitor.md` carries the measured numbers, the corpus they
//! came from, and the shape of the failure this does not cover.
