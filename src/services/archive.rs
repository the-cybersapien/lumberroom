//! Building an archive, and applying one.
//!
//! The only file that knows both the archive format and the store. `crates/archive` holds no
//! database handle and `src/adapters` holds no opinion about archives; this is where the two meet.
//!
//! # An archive is all or nothing
//!
//! [`build`] refuses a caller who cannot read the whole store, rather than filtering rows to what
//! the caller may see. A filtered archive is a partial copy that looks like a complete one, and the
//! person who finds out is the person who already cancelled their old install.
//!
//! This is also why it does not reuse `list_for_export`. That path is bounded by
//! `EXPORT_MAX_SENSITIVITY`, which defaults to `open`, so an archive built through it on a stock
//! deployment would hold open rows alone and say nothing about the rest.
//!
//! # Re-running a half-applied merge
//!
//! The caller passes the id map from the interrupted run and [`apply`] skips any archive id already
//! in it. Idempotence lives there and not in the write path's dedupe bands, which cannot provide
//! it: both bands sit inside `if supersedes_id.is_none()` in `src/services/write.rs`, the
//! exact-match path additionally requires `resolved == Sensitivity::Open`, and `collapse_target`
//! returns `None` for a row that is not live. A replay leaning on them duplicates every superseded
//! row, every private row, and every row the first pass retired.
//!
//! # Private content travels as plaintext
//!
//! No record carries `content_ct`, `dek_wrapped` or `kek_id`. `envelope::seal` authenticates the
//! row id as associated data, so ciphertext copied to another row or another install fails its tag
//! check rather than opening. A private row is decrypted on the way out, travels inside the age
//! layer, and is resealed under the destination's own key.
