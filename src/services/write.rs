//! memory_write(content, namespace, tags?, supersedes?, sensitivity?, occurred_at?) -> WriteOutcome
//!
//! Embed on write, store raw. No extraction and no model call in the write path.
//!
//! This is the densest service in the system because it is the only place where classification,
//! encryption, duplicate collapse and supersession all have to agree about one row. The order of
//! the checks is load-bearing and is written out in the body.
//!
//! Two biases run through the whole file.
//!
//! **Classification only ever goes up.** A caller may raise a write above its namespace default and
//! can never lower it, because a tool that can downgrade classification is a tool that can leak by
//! mistake.
//!
//! **Every duplicate threshold is biased toward storing too much.** Collapsing a correction into
//! its own predecessor destroys data, and it does it silently, which is the part that makes it
//! unacceptable. A store with two rows where one would do is untidy; a store that ate the
//! correction is wrong and nothing in it says so.
//!
//! **Two clocks, never conflated.** `created_at` is when this store learned the fact and the
//! database sets it. `occurred_at` is when the fact held in the world and only a caller can know
//! it. Everything in this file that touches the second one exists to keep it from decaying into a
//! copy of the first.
