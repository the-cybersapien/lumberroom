//! The periodic pass that reads the store as a whole, and the queue it writes into.
//!
//! Every other part of this system looks at one write at a time. `memory_write` checks the row in
//! front of it for a near-duplicate and flags a conflict; the review queue lists pairs above a
//! threshold. Nothing steps back and asks what the store as a whole now contains, and after a month
//! that is where the damage is: four rows a test harness wrote, an injection probe from a security
//! run, two values for the same nickname, and a preference stated twice in different words. None of
//! those is a bug in any write path.
//!
//! # It proposes and never acts
//!
//! The same rule ingestion follows, for the same reason: a personal memory that silently forgets is
//! worse than one that gets cluttered. Applying goes through `review::supersede` and
//! `review::delete`, which already hold the grant check, the ceiling check and the history rules.
//!
//! # What a model is ever shown
//!
//! Rows at `open`. The candidate query runs at the caller's ceiling so that the deterministic half
//! can see private duplicates, and the band handed out for a model is filtered on the way out:
//! a pair with a side above `open` is skipped before it reaches the list. Decision 0005 draws the
//! same line for the lexical index on the same argument: publishing private content to a second
//! system is publishing it. `assert_model_visible` is a second check at the boundary, and it is
//! deliberate redundancy rather than the mechanism.
//!
//! # Whose rows a run reads
//!
//! The scheduled pass reads the whole tenant and hands nothing to anyone, so it runs over
//! `NamespaceGrant::everything()`. An HTTP caller runs over its own read grant, pushed into the
//! query as a term, and a scope it names has to sit inside that grant. `mayIngest` opens the
//! route; it does not widen what the route may read.
//!
//! # The deterministic pass
//!
//! Exact duplicates and the near-certain cosine band need no model and no network. They run first,
//! they run over every sensitivity the caller holds because nothing they read leaves this machine,
//! and on a store this size they are the majority of the findings.
