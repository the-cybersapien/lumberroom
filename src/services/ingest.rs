//! Transcript ingestion, server side. The queue, the approval path, the watermarks and the
//! anti-loop check.
//!
//! **Approval is the only path into the store, and it is one call.** `approve` hands the proposal
//! to `services::write::run`, which is what keeps the credentials-namespace refusal, the
//! classification table and the ceiling check, the grant check, the credential tripwire,
//! exact-duplicate collapse, the dedupe bands with their numeric, identifier and negation guards,
//! and supersession validation in one place. A handler that inserted a row itself would be a second
//! write path with none of those seven checks, and the difference would show up as a stored
//! credential rather than as a failing test.
//!
//! A refused write is not an error the caller has to handle. The proposal stays at `proposed` with
//! `last_error` set, and the owner reads the refusal in the queue.
//!
//! The repository arrives as an argument rather than on `Ctx`. Ingestion has no MCP tool behind it
//! and every caller is an admin route that already holds the port, so the tool path carries no
//! field it never reads.
//!
//! # `mayIngest` opens the routes and widens nothing
//!
//! Every read of the queue goes through the caller's grant, pushed into the query as a term, and a
//! fact is only accepted for a namespace the caller may read at the level the fact would be
//! written at. A client granted ingestion and `project:*` at `open` fills the queue for its
//! projects and sees that much of it; it cannot propose into `global`, cannot list the owner's
//! refusals elsewhere, and cannot block a fingerprint in a namespace it was never given.
