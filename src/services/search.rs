//! memory_search(query, namespaces?, limit?, project?, include_superseded?) -> rows[]
//!
//! Namespace strategy, and why it deviates from the letter of PRD §5: the default set is
//! 'user:me' + 'global' + the active project, exactly as specified, but other project namespaces
//! are also searched at a score penalty rather than excluded. A model that forgets to pass
//! `project` would otherwise be told nothing is known while the fact sits one namespace away.
//! Precedence still holds. SEARCH_INCLUDE_ALL_PROJECTS=false restores strict behaviour.
//!
//! Every namespace travels with the sensitivity ceiling this caller holds for it, and the pair goes
//! into the query. Filtering after the fetch would mean a row the client may not see had already
//! entered the process that answers that client, which is the failure Phase 3 §1 is written to
//! prevent. The check repeated over the results here is a second line, not the line.
//!
//! Ranking stays behind the port, including the usage boost. Re-ranking in Rust would mean the
//! rows the boost promotes were never in the candidate set the database returned.
//!
//! # What may be published as a namespace name
//!
//! One rule, the same one the digest inventory follows: a namespace name reaches a response only
//! once a both-axes filter has put a row behind it. `also_searched` used to publish the discovery
//! set, which comes from `namespace_counts` and is pre-policy by contract, narrowed by
//! `filter_readable`. That call applies the namespace axis alone, so a ceiling of open over a
//! namespace holding only private rows published a name the second axis had already refused. It is
//! the digest inventory bug under a different field name. `namespaces`, the primary set, is
//! different: it comes from the caller's own argument or from `default_read_namespaces`, never from
//! the store, so echoing it back confirms the caller's own grant and nothing about what is stored.
