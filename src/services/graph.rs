//! A bounded walk over the store, for the question similarity cannot answer.
//!
//! Decision 0014 part 4. The failing query joins a held position to a named catalyst, and neither
//! phrase appears in the row that answers it. Measured twice on 25 August 2026: that row scores
//! 0.834 against its own name and does not reach the top twenty of the question describing it, on
//! the live store and on a replica. Nearest-neighbour search has no operator for a join.
//!
//! # Seeded from search, walked over structure
//!
//! Seeds come from the ordinary search, so the walk starts where the question actually points. Edges
//! come from structure the store already holds: supersession links, aliases, curated tags. No model
//! is called. 0014 assumed entity extraction and warned the graph has to earn that cost; these edges
//! cost nothing, and if a bounded walk over them answers no more than search does, the extractor was
//! never the missing piece.
//!
//! # The walk severs, and says nothing about what it withheld
//!
//! Every hop runs inside the caller's subgraph: both endpoints of every edge are readable, at their
//! stored sensitivity, with retired rows admitted only for a caller holding the history capability.
//! A node the caller may not read is not a node it walks through.
//!
//! Nothing reports what was withheld, and that is deliberate. `subject_history` does the opposite,
//! filtering after its recursion so a chain stays whole across a row it must hide, and it can report
//! the gap as a bare count because a chain has one subject and an anchor the caller already named. A
//! graph has neither past the first hop. Its shape **is** the answer, so a count of skipped edges,
//! or even a boolean saying the walk was truncated, is the answer leaking: vary the seed, watch the
//! flag flip, map the boundary.
//!
//! The cost is that a client cannot tell "no path exists" from "no path is yours". 0014 accepts
//! that and names the console, which reads as the owner, as where the whole graph is visible.
