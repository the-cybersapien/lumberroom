//! Deleting, Phase 3 §4. `lumberroom forget <id>`, `lumberroom forget --query "..."`, and `memory_forget`.
//!
//! Phase 1 had no delete path at all, and this is the phase where sensitive content becomes
//! possible, so the two belong together.
//!
//! # Why every caller needs the delete flag
//!
//! The spec calls the CLI path unrestricted and the MCP path opt-in. This module requires
//! `may_delete` from both, because the thing that separates them is a request header the caller
//! chooses. `X-Invocation: cli` costs a model nothing to send, so treating it as an authorisation
//! boundary would make the MCP restriction decorative. The operator's own grant carries
//! `"mayDelete": true` and that is a one-line config change with a visible reason.
//!
//! # Why a query delete has a similarity floor
//!
//! A vector search always returns its nearest rows, however far away they are. Deleting the top N
//! of a fuzzy search would let "forget the old port number" take out the deploy notes sitting
//! beside it. Candidates below the floor are not offered at all, and the dry run prints exactly
//! what is in scope before anything goes.
//!
//! # What happens to the chain
//!
//! A row that retired another row cannot simply go: the retired row points at it. The first
//! version cleared that pointer, which revived the retired row, in whatever namespace it sat and
//! at whatever level, for a caller who might hold neither. A private fact the owner had corrected
//! came back to life because a client with an open ceiling deleted the correction.
//!
//! Now the store is asked who points at the row, and the service decides under the caller's own
//! grant. A doomed row with a successor has its predecessors spliced onto that successor, so they
//! stay retired and the chain reads as one row shorter. A doomed row at the head of its chain
//! revives its predecessors, and only the ones the caller could have deleted themselves; any other
//! predecessor blocks the delete with the same message an unknown id gets, because naming the
//! namespace would map a grant the caller was refused.
